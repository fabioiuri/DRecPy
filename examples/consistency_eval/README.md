## Consistency Evaluation
The scripts present on this folder were used to compute the results of the consistency evaluation of this work.
However, the used data sets are not present here, since they would be too big to maintain on this repository.

### Baseline Recommenders
For the baseline recommenders, there's one script for each data set, where we can find:
1. An initial data set loading instruction;
2. A split instructor that produces a train and test data set;
3. Model initialization and training;
4. Model evaluation.

Steps 3 and 4 repeat for each similarity function used during the training process (cosine, Jaccard, mean squared differences and Pearson correlation).

Paper used as reference for the comparison: is M. Barros, A. Moitinho and F. M. Couto, "Using Research Literature to Generate Datasets of Implicit Feedback for Recommending Scientific Items," in IEEE Access, vol. 7, pp. 176668-176680, 2019.

### Deep Recommenders
For the deep learning based recommenders, the DMF model is used, which is described in Xue, H.-J., Dai, X., Zhang, J., Huang, S., and Chen, J. (2017). Deep matrix factorization models for recommender systems. InIJCAI, pages 3203â€“3209.

There are two models present on this test, the DMF-CE and DMF-NCE, where the first one receives interaction values on their original scale, while the last variant receives binary interaction values (every interaction present on the data set is set to 1, and all the others are assumed to be 0).
