## Consistency Evaluation
The scripts present on this folder were used to compute the results of the consistency evaluation section of the thesis.
However, the used data sets are not present here, since they would be too big to maintain on this repository.

For the baseline recommenders, there's one script for each data set, where we can find:
1. An initial data set loading instruction;
2. A split instructor that produces a train and test data set;
3. Model initialization and training;
4. Model evaluation.

Steps 3 and 4 repeat for each similarity function used during the training process (cosine, Jaccard, mean squared differences and Pearson correlation).

For the deep learning based recommenders, the DMF model is used, which is described in Xue, H.-J., Dai, X., Zhang, J., Huang, S., and Chen, J. (2017). Deep matrix factorization models forrecommender systems. InIJCAI, pages 3203â€“3209.
